# Save_African_Covid19
Using IA method to save african life againt coronavirus 

* Vision and Plans

The world is in a disastrous situation.  As of yesterday April 10,
worldmeters [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/] reported
1,605,790 coronavirus cases and 95,766 deaths.  The economy is low and
people suffered. We believe, as a team composed of developers and
researcher on IT, product design, data analysis and biotech, that we
can make contributions from our aspects to help the people to curb the
pandemic situation.

Our goal of this Hackaton is to develop a prototype for massive
coronavirus diagnosing via deep learning. Later, we want to apply for
fundings, e.g. fast-grant [https://fastgrants.org/] for improving the
project.  Ultimately, we hope to develop a software and data platform
that will be widely used by ordinarly people around the world, as an
accurate, cost-effective, and easy-to-use solution that can accurately
diagnose the COVID-19 virus and complement doctors' diagonsis and
testing.

We plan to:

1. Build a website to collect data of people's symptoms
2. Manage the datebase, making it usable to other researchers while
   taking care of privacy concerns.
3. Build a neural network to learn from the data. The learned model
   allows us to make a diagnose.

* Team (on-going)

Our team needs
- a project manager 
- web designers 
- data people who take charge of data storage, privacy, etc.
- AI developers
- a software tester 

We also need expertise from a mentor. Our concern might be how to get
the initial data

Currently, we have:

- Anaïs hijos, data analyst at Amgen. Anais is our project
  manager. She will also take charge of the database, the
  communication and the business
model. Anais has strong connection in the healthcare sector.
- Anne Nicole, product designer. Anne will contribute to the
  web-design:

- Rishab Khincha, pre-final year student from India double majoring in
  Physics and Computer Science.  Rishab's expertise lies in Machine
  learning, Artificial Intelligence and open source python
  programming.
- Adnan Mohd, graduate student at University of Waterloo. Mohd's
  expertise lies in Statistical Machine Learning, Probabilistic Deep
  Learning and its
application in Vision. 
- Zhoulai Fu (Call me "July"), Assistant Professor of Computer Science
  at IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I used to work on software
  analysis and testing.



* Problems to solve

** Website
We need to show a preliminary website and argue for the design
choices. Two things are the most important above all.
-  the kind of data we need to collect
-  how we take care of privacy concerns

** Data
We need to consider 
- how the data should be stored. E.g. place of storage and format

** Deep Learning
We need to consider
- What we can do at the very beginning as few data are available.
